# Deep Learning of Force Manifolds from the Simulated Physics of Robotic Paper Folding

This repo contains the source code for the manuscript "*Deep Learning of Force Manifolds from the Simulated Physics of Robotic Paper Folding*".

The simulation framework used to generate all training data can be found in the `simulation` directory with a separate README.

Optimal folding trajectories using the pretrained neural force manifold model can be generated by running the `main.py` script.

Python dependencies include
```bash
numpy
scipy
shapely
torch
matplotlib
```
